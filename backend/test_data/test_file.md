### Test file

This file is to be used in the integration tests to extract and execute the code blocks contained within it.

#### Rust Hello world!

Let's use our tangle functionality to extract the following code blocks into a single file for later execution.

1. First, we define the main function, where the program execution begins:

```Rust
fn main() {
```

2. Next, we use the `println!` macro to print the string `"Hello, world!"`

```Rust
   println!("Hello, world!");
```

3. Finally, we close the main function definition with `}`:

```Rust
}
```
